# DelayBot

GroupMe bot that checks your county's Facebook page and posts it to the GroupMe if it contains info about school delays/closings.

<h2>
Setup
</h2>
Run `git clone https://github.com/xXCoolinXx/DelayBot`. In the cloned repository, you will need to create a `.env` file with the fields `FB_PAGE` and `BOT_ID` filled with your school/county's facebook page name and GroupMe bot ID. <br>

To get a GroupMe bot, follow the instructions <a href=https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/bots> here</a>. <br>

In order to run, the bot will also need a `cookies.json` of your Facebook cookies. To obtain these, see the <a href=https://pypi.org/project/facebook-scraper>Facebook Scraper</a> website and scroll down to cookies.
